### Greetings traveller ðŸ§™

I'm a software engineer.

ðŸ”­ Most of my day is switching between different branches (don't tell my manager) so I'm trying to make that easier with [git-switch](https://github.com/cdlewis/git-switch).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust.

âš¡ Fun fact: I was sorted into Hufflepuff.
